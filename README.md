# All_ResNet_Implementations

Implementation of Resnet18, Resnet34 and Resnet50 as per the original paper (in Tensorflow)

In this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/archit-lahiri/All_ResNet_Implementations/blob/main/ResNet.ipynb) file I implement the Resnet architectures as they were proposed in the paper:
